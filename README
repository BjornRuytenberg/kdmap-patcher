====
SLICLoader - EFI program that modifies ACPI tables before boot
====

==Building==

This program must be built using the EDKII toolchain. For example,
place this folder into edk2/MdeModulesPkg/Application and add the
.inf file to edk2/MdeModulesPkg/MdeModulesPkg.dsc and run the
EDK build program.

The build has only been tested on 64-bit Linux with GCC 4.7.
The program itself has only been tested on a 64-bit little-endian
platform with ACPI version 2. ACPI version 1 is supported and may
work, but has not been tested.
